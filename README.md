# Huffman
A Huffman (De)compressor

## Usage

huffman [options] \<filename\>
  
## Options

### Mode Select:
  -c for compress  
  -d for decompress
  Per default non is selectet, hence one of the above is needed
  
### Verbose
  -v to get a verbose output  
  You'll get a filesize of the in-and-output file and the time it took the programm to do the thing
 
### Costum outlife-name
  As per default it appends a .hc for compressed and .hd for decompressed files.  
  If you choose to have a different name you can spezify it via the  
  -o   
  option
  
### Help
 As by now only -h gives you the help in german.  
 A localized version is WIP
